First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2015

Name: Dennis Xu

Date started: 10/26/15

Date finished: 10/27/15

Hours worked: 2

Resources used: GitHub, CS308 website

Main class file: Unknown as of now

Data (non Java) files needed: Images of fish

How to play the game: The game allows the user to control a clownfish and its movement by using the up, down, left and right arrows. The fish moves in an ocean with other bigger fish around. If the clownfish collides with another fish, then they will engage in a battle (a different interface). The clownfish will have different moves to use, and if he survives, then he can continue onwards on his journey to his home. However, any Health Points the clownfish loses, he loses it permanently. If the clownfish loses all of his health points, then it is game over. If the fish gets to his home with health points remaining, the game is won.

Keys/Mouse input: Up, down, left, right arrows help direct moves

Cheat Keys: N/A

Known bugs: N/A

Extra features: Unknown as of now

Impressions/Suggestions: Good way to brainstorm about the game and consider whether my ideas were innovative, creative, and feasible before actually coding.
